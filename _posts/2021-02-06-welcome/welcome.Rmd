For this week's Tidy Tuesday challenge we looked at data about wealth and inequality in the United States.  I did a simple area plot of the median wealth of Black, Hispanic, and White families from 1989-2016.  The disparity is huge! The visualization shows that while the wealth of White families increased and decreased as a function of economic changes; the wealth of Blank and Hispanic families remained low.
